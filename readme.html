<p><h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to version 2.5 of the GLFW OpenGL framework. GLFW is a free,
open source, portable framework for OpenGL application development. In
short, it is a library that constitutes a powerful API for handling
operating system specific tasks, such as opening an OpenGL window, reading
keyboard and mouse input, creating threads, and much more.

<p><h2>2. Compiling GLFW and the example programs</h2>

<p>A top level makefile can be found in the root directory of the GLFW
distribution that has been designed to work with several compilers. If you
simply enter the GLFW root directory in a shell and type <b>make</b> (or
<b>nmake</b> or <b>gmake</b>, depending on the name of your make
tool), and a list should appear with the currently supported options for
systems and compilers.

<p>For example, one of the options is to compile GLFW for Windows with
the LCC-Win32 C compiler. To do that, type <b>make win32-lcc</b> in the
shell (as specified in the previously mentioned list). That will compile
the GLFW static link library and the supplied example programs. For
Windows compilers, a Win32 DLL will also be compiled.

<p>Currently supported compilers and systems are:

<ol>
  <li>Borland C++ Builder compiler 5.x for Windows</li>
  <li>Cygwin (GCC) for Windows</li>
  <li>LCC-Win32 for Windows</li>
  <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 6.x for Windows</li>
  <li>MinGW32 (GCC) for Windows</li>
  <li>OpenWatcom for Windows</li>
  <li>Pelles C for Windows</li>
  <li>Unix or Unix-like systems running the X Window System (auto detect
      compiler, or force GCC)</li>
  <li>Geek Gadgets (GCC) for AmigaOS</li>
  <li>VBCC for AmigaOS</li>
  <li>Apple Developer Tools (GCC) for Mac OS X</li>
  <li>DJGPP (GCC) for DOS</li>
</ol>

<p>If your compiler/system is not in the list, you will have to create new
makefiles in the <b>lib\win32</b>, <b>lib/x11</b>, <b>lib/amigaos</b>,
<b>lib/macosx</b> or <b>lib\dos</b> directory, and in the <b>examples</b>
directory. If you have any problems, do not hesitate to contact me (I may
not know how your compiler works, but I know the GLFW source code). I would
also like to add support for more compilers and verify that GLFW compiles
under as many systems as possible, so if you had to make any modifications
or additions to the source and/or makefiles in order to make GLFW compile
successfully, I would like to know what you had to do.


<p><br><h3>2.1 Note for Microsoft Visual C++ users</h3>

<p>When MSVC is installed, you are asked if it should be possible to
access the compiler from the command line. For some strange reason, the
default answer to this question is NO. If you answered no to this question
you will have to run a file named <b>VCVARS32.BAT</b>, which is located in
the <b>bin</b> directory of your Visual C++ folder, before you can use the
compiler from the command line.

<p>Note that <b>VCVARS32.BAT</b> must be run from the same shell as you
intend to use for compiling GLFW (simply clicking on the file from the
explorer will <i>not</i> work).

<p>After that is done, it is possible to compile GLFW by entering the GLFW
root directory and issuing <b>nmake win32-msvc</b>.

<p>For instance, if MSVC is installed in the directory 'C:\Program
Files\Microsoft Developer Studio\VC98', then you should be able to compile
GLFW with this procedure:
<ol>
  <li>Start a command prompt (MS-DOS prompt)</li>
  <li>"CD" to the directory where you unzipped the GLFW source
      distribution (where this readme file is located)</li>
  <li>Type <b>&quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Developer
      Studio\VC98\BIN\VCVARS32&quot;</b> (with quotation marks)</li>
  <li>Type <b>nmake win32-msvc</b></li>
</ol>


<p><br><h3>2.2 Note for MinGW/DevC++ users</h3>

<p>Do not use the MSYS shell for compiling GLFW, because the supplied
batch file "compile.bat" will only work under a Windows command prompt (or
MS-DOS prompt).

<p>Under Windows 98, the MinGW make program may set the $(MAKE) variable
incorrectly. To remedy this, uncomment the line at the beginning of the
top level Makefile that says MAKE = make (possibly replacing make with
some other name, e.g. mingw32-make).


<p><br><h3>2.3 Note for Cygwin users</h3>

<p>The top level makefile was designed to run from a Cygwin bash shell.
You can <i>not</i> use an MS-DOS prompt (or NT cmd prompt) to compile GLFW
with the win32-cygwin option. Similarly, the win32-clean option will not
work from a Cygwin shell, which is why there is a special cygwin-clean
option.


<p><br><h3>2.4 Note for OpenWatcom users</h3>

<p>In order to compile GLFW successfully with OpenWatcom (for Windows),
execute "nmake MAKE=nmake win32-ow" in the GLFW root directory. Also make
sure that you have all your environment variables set up correctly. It is
the default option when installing OpenWatcom to permanently set up all
the required environment variables. If nmake does not work, you probably
have to run "WATCOM\setvars.bat" from the command prompt before executing
nmake, where WATCOM is the directory in which you installed OpenWatcom
(e.g. C:\Watcom).


<p><br><h3>2.5 Note for Pelles C users</h3>

<p>To build GLFW with Pelles C, you need at lest version 2.80.3 of Pelles C
(POCC and POLINK).

<p>Type 'pomake win32-pellesc' to build GLFW.


<p><br><h3>2.6 Note for Unix/X11 users</h3>

<p>Compiler and link library capabilities are auto-detected with a script
called <b>compile.sh</b>. It has been tested under Linux Mandrake 9.1,
Mac OS X 10.2, SunOS 5.6 (GCC), IRIX 5.3, FreeBSD 5.0 and QNX, but should
hopefully run on the majority of available Unix/Unix-like systems and
generate functional Makefiles. You do not have to run the script manually,
since it is called from the top level Makefile.


<p><br><h3>2.7 Note for AmigaOS users</h3>

<p>The current AmigaOS implementation of GLFW requires VBCC (an excellent
free C compiler) or Geek Gadgets GCC, the StormMesa developer package, and
of course the AmigaOS include files (not included with VBCC or GCC due to
copyright reasons).

<p>To compile GLFW and the example programs for AmigaOS (68k) with VBCC,
you need a make program that understands AmigaDOS paths. I use the SAS/C
compiled version of GNU make 3.75, which can be found on Aminet.

<p>It should also be noted that the current version of GLFW for AmigaOS is
only a subset of the full GLFW API. Most of the core functionality has
been implemented, but there are still some things missing (e.g. hiding the
mouse cursor in windowed mode, iconification handling etc).


<p><br><h3>2.8 Note for Mac OS X users</h3>

<p>To compile GLFW for Mac OS X, you will need to have installed the BSD
subsystem and the Developer Tools, which can be found on your Mac OS X
CD:s. When they are installed, simply open Terminal and go to the
root GLFW directory. From there, you can build the library and all the
examples by running make, i.e. <b>make macosx-gcc</b>.


<p><br><h3>2.9 Note for DOS users</h3>

<p>The current port for DOS is very preliminiary. It is based on alpha
versions of DJGPP and Mesa 5.1, and in my experience the mouse interface
seems error prone (random crashes). At the moment the DOS port should be
considered experiemental at best, so use it at your own risk.

<p>Also, if you decide to build GLFW under pure DOS you will need some
software to support long file names (I have used DOSLFN without problems).

<p><h2>3. Installing GLFW</h2>

<p><h3>3.1 Windows</h3>

<p>After compiling GLFW with MinGW32 or Cygwin, three files of interest
should have appeared in the <b>lib\win32</b> directory. They are:
<b>libglfw.a</b> (the static link version of GLFW), <b>glfw.dll</b> (the
DLL version of GLFW) and <b>libglfwdll.a</b> (the DLL import library).

<p>If you used Borland C++ Builder, LCC-Win32, Microsoft Visual C++ or
OpenWatcom, the files are named <b>glfw.lib</b> (the static link version
of GLFW), <b>glfw.dll</b> (the DLL version of GLFW) and <b>glfwdll.lib</b>
(the DLL import library).

<p>The static link library and the DLL import library should be copied to
your compiler's <b>LIB</b> directory (where all other link libraries are
located). The DLL can be copied either to your Windows system directory
(where opengl32.dll is located), or to the project directory of your
GLFW-based projects (where you place your compiled EXEs).

<p>You should also copy the GLFW include file, <b>include\GL\glfw.h</b>,
to the <b>GL</b> directory of your compiler's include directory (where
gl.h, glu.h etc. are located).


<p><br><h3>3.2 Unix</h3>

<p>After compiling GLFW, a file named <b>libglfw.a</b> should have
appeared in the <b>lib/x11</b> directory. This is the GLFW static link
library, which should be copied to your compiler's <b>lib</b> directory
(where all other link libraries are located).

<p>You should also copy the GLFW include file, <b>include/GL/glfw.h</b>,
to the <b>GL</b> directory of your compiler's include directory (where
gl.h, glu.h etc. are located).


<p><br><h3>3.3 AmigaOS</h3>

<p>After compiling GLFW, a file named <b>glfw.lib</b> should have
appeared in the <b>lib/amigaos</b> directory. This is the GLFW static link
library, which should be copied to your compiler's <b>lib</b> directory
(where all other link libraries are located).

<p>You should also copy the GLFW include file, <b>include/GL/glfw.h</b>,
to the <b>GL</b> directory of your compiler's include directory (where
gl.h, glu.h etc. are located).


<p><br><h3>3.4 Mac OS X</h3>

<p>After compiling GLFW, a file named <b>libglfw.a</b> should appear in
the <b>lib/macosx</b> directory. This is the GLFW static library, which
should be copied to an appropriate <b>lib</b> directory, preferrably
<b>/usr/local/lib</b>. Note that you must run <b>ranlib</b> on the library
after it has been copied, in order for it to be usable, i.e.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>sudo cp libglfw.a /usr/local/lib</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>sudo ranlib /usr/local/lib/libglfw.a</b>

<p>You should also copy the GLFW include file, <b>include/GL/glfw.h</b>,
to the <b>GL</b> directory of an appropriate <b>include</b> directory,
preferrably <b>/usr/local/include</b>, i.e.:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include/GL</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>sudo cp glfw.h /usr/local/include/GL</b>

<p><hr>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->

<a name="sec4">
<p><h2>4. Using GLFW</h2>

<p>There are two aspects to using GLFW:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>How does the GLFW API work</li>
  <li>How to compile programs that use GLFW</li>
</ol>

<p>The first point is covered in the <a href="docs/UsersGuide.pdf">GLFW
Users Guide</a> and the <a href="docs/Reference.pdf">GLFW Reference
Manual</a>, and I suggest that you read at least the Users Guide, since
it is a good introduction to the GLFW API.

<p>Designing and compiling programs that use GLFW is not very difficult.
A few rules for successfully designing GLFW-based programs are presented
in the following sections.

<p><br><h3>4.1 Include &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt;</h3>

<p>In your program, you should include &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt;. This include
file defines all the necessary constants, types and prototypes that are
used to interact with the GLFW API. It also includes &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; and
&lt;GL/glu.h&gt;, and - <u>this is very important</u> - <i><b>it defines
all the necessary constants and types that are necessary for OpenGL to
work on different platforms</b></i>.

<p>For instance, under Windows you are normally required to include
&lt;windows.h&gt; before you include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;. If you write such a
program, it would not compile under e.g. Linux since &lt;windows.h&gt;
does not exist under Linux. &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt; takes care of these things
for you. Note however that it does not actually include &lt;windows.h&gt;,
it merely mimics the parts of it that are needed for &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; and
&lt;GL/glu.h&gt; (this way we do not get the thousands of constants,
types and prototypes that could otherwise possibly interfere with our own
declarations).

<p>In other words:
<ul>
  <li>Do <i>not</i> include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; or &lt;GL/glu.h&gt;! (GLFW
      does it for you)</li>
  <li>Do <i>not</i> include &lt;windows.h&gt;! (unless you really need
      it)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If you <i>do</i> need to include &lt;windows.h&gt;, do it
<i>before</i> including &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt;.


<p><br><h3>4.2 Link with the right libraries</h3>

<p><h4>4.2.1 Windows static library</h4>

<p>If you link with the static version of GLFW, it is also necessary to
link with some system libraries that GLFW uses.

<p>When linking a program under Windows that uses the static version of
GLFW, you must also link with the following libraries: <b>opengl32</b>,
<b>user32</b> and <b>kernel32</b>. Some of these libraries may be linked
with by default by your compiler. In the table below you can see the
minimum required link options for each supported Windows compiler (you may
want to add other libraries as well, such as <b>glu32</b>):

<p><table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Compiler</b></td><td><b>Link options</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Borland C++ Builder</td><td>glfw.lib opengl32.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cygwin</td><td>-lglfw -lopengl32</td></tr>
<tr><td>LCC-Win32</td><td>glfw.lib opengl32.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft Visual C++</td><td>glfw.lib opengl32.lib user32.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>MinGW32</td><td>-lglfw -lopengl32</td></tr>
<tr><td>OpenWatcom</td><td>glfw.lib opengl32.lib user32.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pelles C</td><td>glfw.lib opengl32.lib user32.lib kernel32.lib</td></tr>
</table>


<p><br><h4>4.2.2 Windows DLL</h4>

<p>To compile a program that uses the DLL version of GLFW, you need to
define the <b>GLFW_DLL</b> constant. This can either be done with a
compiler switch, typically by adding <b>-DGLFW_DLL</b> to the list of
compiler options. You can also do it by adding the line:

<p>#define GLFW_DLL

<p>...to all your source files that include <b>glfw.h</b>, <u>before</u>
including it.

<p>When linking a program under Windows that uses the DLL version of GLFW,
the only library you need to link with for GLFW to work is <b>glfwdll</b>.
In the table below you can see the minimum required link options for each
supported Windows compiler (you may want to add other libraries as well,
such as <b>opengl32</b> and <b>glu32</b>):

<p><table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Compiler</b></td><td><b>Link options</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Borland C++ Builder</td><td>glfwdll.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cygwin</td><td>-lglfwdll</td></tr>
<tr><td>LCC-Win32</td><td>glfwdll.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft Visual C++</td><td>glfwdll.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>MinGW32</td><td>-lglfwdll</td></tr>
<tr><td>OpenWatcom</td><td>glfwdll.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pelles C</td><td>glfwdll.lib</td></tr>
</table>


<p><br><h4>4.2.3 Unix static library</h4>

<p>Since there are so many flavors of Unix and Unix-like systems, it is
impossible to give a standard rule for properly linking GLFW applications.
In general, it is a good idea to look at the automatically generated
<b>Makefile.x11</b> file in the examples directory, which should contain
all the necessary compiler and linker directives. Following is a brief
description of what should work for many (but not all) systems:

<p>When compiling and linking a program under Unix/X11 that uses GLFW, you
must also link with the following libraries: <b>GL</b>, <b>X11</b> and
<b>pthread</b>. For XFree86 you also need to link with <b>Xxf86vm</b>.

<p>Of course, in all cases you should also link with <b>glfw</b>.

<p>A typical compile and link command line may look like this (using gcc):

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>gcc myprog.c -o myprog -lglfw -lGL -lX11 -lpthread</b>

<p>For XFree86 you also add <b>-lXxf86vm</b>, and under Linux (and perhaps
other environments) you need to specify the location of the X11 library
files using <b>-L/usr/X11R6/lib</b>:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>gcc myprog.c -o myprog -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lglfw -lGL -lX11 -lpthread -lXxf86vm</b>

<p>FreeBSD systems require that you use <b>-pthread</b> instead of
<b>-lpthread</b>.

<p>QNX systems require that you use <b>-lsocket</b> instead of
<b>-lpthread</b>. Usually, X11 is installed in /opt instead of /usr under
QNX, so use <b>-L/opt/X11R6/lib</b>.

<p>To use GLFW from KDevelop under Linux, you usually add the following to
<b>Project->Project&nbsp;Options->Configure&nbsp;Options->Linker&nbsp;Flags</b>:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lglfw -lGL -lXxf86vm -lpthread</b>

<p>If you use GLU functions in your program you should also add
<b>-lGLU</b>.




<p><br><h4>4.2.4 AmigaOS static library</h4>

<p>When compiling and linking a program under AmigaOS that uses GLFW, you
must also link with the following libraries: <b>GL</b>, <b>amiga</b> and
<b>m</b> (the latter can be <b>m881</b> or <b>m040</b> etc, depending on
which compiler and CPU you use).

<p>Of course, in all cases you should also link with <b>glfw</b>.

<p>A typical compile and link command line may look like this (using vbcc):

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>vc -cpu=68020 -fpu=68881 -lglfw -lGL -lamiga -lm881 -o myprog myprog.c</b>

<p>Hint: For VBCC, you can specify <b>-c99</b> to support things like C++
style comments.


<p><br><h4>4.2.5 Mac OS X static library</h4>

<p>When compiling and linking a program under Mac OS X that uses GLFW, you
must also link with the following frameworks: <b>Carbon.framework</b>,
<b>AGL.framework</b> and <b>OpenGL.framework</b>.

<p>If you are using an IDE, such as Project Builder or Xcode, you simply add
the GLFW library <b>libglfw.a</b> and these frameworks to your project. If,
however, you are building your program from the command line, you will need
to add them to your command line using the <b>-l</b> and <b>-framework</b>
switches, i.e.:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>gcc -o myprog myprog.c -lglfw -framework Carbon -framework AGL -framework OpenGL</b>

<p>Note that you do not add the extension to a framework when adding it from
the command line.

<p>These frameworks contain all GL and GLU functions, so there is no need to
add additional libraries or frameworks when using GLU functionality. Also note
that even though your machine may have Unix-style GL libraries, they are for
use with the X server, and will <i>not</i> work with the Mac OS X native
version of GLFW.

 <li>Removed the silly limitation of 100 threads (the thread information
     is now kept in a linked list)</li>
 <li>General source cleanup (window state is now kept in a single
     struct, plus some other minor changes)</li>
 <li>[X11] Added Solaris gethrtime() support (not tested yet), which
     should give an improved timer for Sun/Solaris stations</li>
 <li>[X11] Some fixes to the 'compile.sh' script (-O for non-gcc compilers
     and 'make x11-gcc' should now really force GCC)</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v2.3.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[X11] A minimalist configuration script was added that solves the
     issue with glXGetProcAddressARB, and unifies all Unix/X11 Makefiles
     into one template Makefile (well, one for GLFW, and one for the
     examples)</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v2.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added OpenGL stereo rendering support</li>
 <li>Added a function for parsing the OpenGL version string
     (glfwGetGLVersion)</li>
 <li>[x86] Bugfix: Hopefully the CPU core clock dependent timer RDTSC will
     never be used on CPUs with variable core frequencies anymore</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW could create stereo rendering capable windows,
     even if it was not requested (GLFW v2.2.x did not support selection
     of stereo rendering)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetProcAddress returned NULL on most systems (even
     on those that supported glXGetProcAddressARB). Now GLFW assumes that
     glXGetProcAddressARB is supported on all systems, which solves the
     bug, but may result in compiler errors on some systems (please let me
     know if you have any related problems).</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v2.2.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Bugfix: Checking for GL_SGIS_generate_mipmap is more robust</li>
 <li>Bugfix: glfwLoadTexture2D will now fail if no window is opened</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Right shift was not detected under Win 9x/ME (it is
     still not as good as under NT/2K/XP, but at least you get right
     shifts)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Visuals are now selected more accurately. For instance,
     glfwOpenWindow will no longer fail if you request a 24-bit color
     buffer if only 16-bit color visuals are avilable (which means that
     pong3d should work on 16-bit displays).</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v2.2.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Windows did not always get focus (this was a tough
     one!)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwGetWindowParam did not work with
     GLFW_ACCUM_*_BITS or GLFW_AUX_BUFFERS</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Linux joystick Y axis positions were reversed</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v2.2.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[X11] Added joystick support for Linux</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v2.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added joystick support (only supported under Windows so far)</li>
 <li>Added joystick controls to pong3d.c (only 3 more lines of code)</li>
 <li>Added glfwOpenWindowHint() function</li>
 <li>It is now possible to specify a desired vertical monitor refresh
     rate (for fullscreen windows)</li>
 <li>It is now possible to request an accumulator buffer and auxiliary
     buffers</li>
 <li>Added glfwSetTime() function</li>
 <li>Added a GLFW conversion of the MESA/GLUT gears.c demo to the example
     programs</li>
 <li>[Win32] gdi32.dll and winmm.dll are now loaded dynamically when
     glfwInit() is called. This means that there is no need to link with
     gdi32.lib or winmm.lib when using the static version of GLFW, which
     should make GLFW usage more convenient.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Greatly improved keyboard input (detect left/right
     CTRL etc)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwExtensionSupported now detects all WGL extensions
     (e.g. WGL_ARB_pbuffer)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Mouse cursor was not re-hidden when a GLFW window was
     deselected and then selected again (with ALT+TAB)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Minor bug in the SGI timer - and ugly (unintended) SGI
     timer debug info removed</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetDesktopMode and glfwGetVideoModes no longer give
     segmentation faults if no X server is available</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v2.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added image and texture loading capabilities (support for the TGA
     file format at the moment)</li>
 <li>Added a new example program (mipmaps.c) for showing off the automatic
     mipmap generation and texture loading capabilities of GLFW 2.1</li>
 <li>Removed the separate TGA loader (tga.c in the examples directory)
     since texture loading is supported natively by GLFW. Also updated the
     Pong3D demo to use GLFW texture loading instead of tga.c.</li>
 <li>Improved keyboard handling (e.g. numeric keypad keys can be
     detected)</li>
 <li>Added a new example program, keytest.c</li>
 <li>Changed the GLFWvidmode structure and the corresponding API functions
     to report pure color bits instead of the confusing (and unportable)
     "BPP" field</li>
 <li>Changed glfwSetWindowSize so that it operates in fullscreen mode
     too</li>
 <li>Added mouse wheel support under Windows (not Win95) and X11</li>
 <li>Added window iconification functions (glfwInconifyWindow and
     glfwRestoreWindow)</li>
 <li>Improved iconification and deactivation handling under both Windows
     and X11</li>
 <li>Made it possible to turn on/off key repeat (the default is now no key
     repeat)</li>
 <li>Added SGI hardware timer support (CLOCK_SGI_CYCLE) for improved
     timer resolution for SGI computers</li>
 <li>Added support for the free Borland C++ Builder 5.x compiler for
     Windows</li>
 <li>Made it possible to compiler GLFW as a Windows DLL using any of the
     supported compilers</li>
 <li>Some constants have changed names (e.g. GLFW_REDBITS is now called
     GLFW_RED_BITS)</li>
 <li>Updated GLFW documentation (GLFW Users Guide and GLFW Reference
     Manual) to reflect the changes in the API</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Corrected Cygwin toplevel makefile entry</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Fixed event lag bug</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Fixed Radeon 8500 crash</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Fixed the window close bug</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Iconification/deactivation is now detected</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Non-OpenGL visuals are not listed anymore</li>
 <li>[XFree86] Bugfix: Undesired video mode changes are now prevented</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v2.0.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added precise CPU cycle based timing support (RDTSC) for x86
     CPUs (under both Windows and Unix)</li>
 <li>Added a makefile option for building for Windows with Cygwin</li>
 <li>Corrected the CC for Unix/X11 makefiles (-Wall is usually not a
     supported flag for CC, so it was removed from the CFLAGS list)</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v2.0.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added a makefile option for building for X11 with 'cc' rather than
     'gcc' (useful for IRIX users for instance).</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Mouse coordinates are now relative to the window
     upper left corner, which also means that disabling the mouse cursor
     in windowed mode should work much better.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Added a bunch of more keys that are recognized by
     GLFW.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetNumberOfProcessors now works for IRIX (earlier
     versions of GLFW would not compile under IRIX).</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v2.0.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>glfwTerminate() will now be called automatically upon normal program
     termination (using atexit())</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Buffer-swapping did not work if a window lost
     focus.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Top level Makefile did not work under Windows
     9x.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: NULL declaratoin in glfw.h was not MSVC 7.x
     compatible.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW would not build with C++ (e.g. g++).</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.0</h3>
<ul>
 <li>GLFW is no longer a single source file, but an entire link library.</li>
 <li>Added multi threading support.</li>
 <li>Added more window control.</li>
 <li>New distribution layout (both Win32 and X11 version in same archive).</li>
 <li>Added GLFW Users Manual and GLFW Reference Manual as PDF files.</li>
 <li>Some bugfixes.</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>v1.0.2</h3>
